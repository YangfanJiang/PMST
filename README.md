# PMST
Source code for PMST: a custom Python-based Monte Carlo Simulation Tool for research and system development in portable pinhole gamma cameras.
PMST can support multiprocessing by running demo.py. It also includes parameters_ini and parameters_2.ini which are examples of running PMST by default material properties with and without user-uploaded files respectively. Using parameters_2.ini, its contents need to be copied to parameters.ini, otherwise, change the source code in geo11.py. 
requirement.txt provides required Python environment settings
